# FlowCalc

FlowCalc is a set of Python tools for planning flow experiments. Currently, it provides a way to produce `.nfp` files by building flow profiles as numpy arrays.

The code is extensible towards other output types.

Hope it's useful for you!

## Installation

`pip` or `conda` install `numpy` in a python 3 environment. The latest versions should work. Then use you preferred method to allow FlowCalc to be imported (`pip install -e FlowCalc`, or `conda develop FlowCalc`). Or, you can add the code into your project directory.
